100 Days of Python Code
Welcome to my "100 Days of Python" repository! Here, I'm storing all the code I'm writing as I learn Python. Each day's work is organized by day number, making it easy to follow my progress. Feel free to explore, though keep in mind I'm not a teacher – I'm just a learner sharing my journey.

Getting Around
Code for each day is in its numbered folder (e.g., Day01/).
No fancy explanations – just my code as I learn.
Connect with me on social media or shoot me a message if you'd like to chat!
Happy coding!
