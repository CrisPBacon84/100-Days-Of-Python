# 100 Days of Python Code

Welcome to my "100 Days of Python" repository! Here, I'm storing all the code I'm writing as I learn Python. Each day's work is organized by day number.

## Getting Around

- Code for each day is in its numbered folder (e.g., Day01/).
- Connect with me on social media if you'd like to chat!

Happy coding!

Note: This repository is for personal use and learning.
